* Information
  - Name: [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array]
  - Link: [https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/]
  - Difficulty: [Easy]
  - Date: <2025-06-26>
  - Problem Type:Array

* Approach & Code

** Approach 1

- Given an integer array  in non decreading order remove the
  duplicate in place so that the elements appears only once and the
  relative order of elements shouldnot change.
- Return the no of elements that is non duplicate in the resulting array
- if an array is ~[0,0,1,2,3,3,4]~ then the resulting array is
  supposed to be ~[0,1,2,3,4]~ and the resulting output is


#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :exports both
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        if not nums:
            return 0

        k = 1  # Initialize the count of unique elements to 1
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != nums[i - 1]:
                nums[k] = nums[i]  # Overwrite the next unique element
                k += 1

        return k
  nums = [0,0,1,2,3,3,4];
  out = Solution();
  res = out.removeDuplicates(nums)
