  - Name: [Remove Element]
  - Link: [https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/]
  - Difficulty: [Easy]
  - Date: <2025-06-25>
  - Problem Type: Array

* Approach & Code

** Approach 1

- There is an array of numbers ~nums~ and a value named ~val~ remove
  all the occurrances of the ~val~ from the ~nums~ and keep only the
  numbers that are not equal to ~val~.
- Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain
  the elements which are not equal to val.
- The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size
  of nums.
- Return k.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :exports both
  class Solution(object):
      def removeElement(self, nums, val):
          count1 = nums.count(val)
          for i in range(count1):
              nums.remove(val)
          return len(nums)

    nums = [3,2,2,3]
    val = 3
    out = solution()
    res = out.removeElement(nums,val)
    print(res)
